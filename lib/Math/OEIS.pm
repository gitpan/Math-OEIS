=head1 SYNOPSIS

=for test_synopsis my ($filename, $basename);

 use Math::OEIS;
 $filename = Math::OEIS->local_filename($basename);

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over

=item C<@dirs = Math::OEIS-E<gt>local_directories()>

Return a list of local OEIS directories to look for downloaded sequences and
related files.  Currently this is only F<~/OEIS>, ie. an F<OEIS>
sub-directory of the user's home directory (per C<File::HomeDir>).

=item C<$filename = Math::OEIS-E<gt>local_filename($basename)>

Find file C<$basename> in one of the C<local_directories()> directories.  If
found then return a filename including directory part.  If not found then
return C<undef>.
