=head1 NAME

Math::OEIS::Names - read the OEIS F<names> file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $name = Math::OEIS::Names->anum_to_name('A123456');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an interface to the OEIS F<names> file.  The file should be
downloaded and unzipped to F<~/OEIS/names>,

    cd ~/OEIS
    wget http://oeis.org/names.gz
    gunzip names.gz

F<names> is a very large file listing each A-number and the sequence name.
The name is a single line description, perhaps a slightly long line.

The F<names> file is sorted by A-number so C<anum_to_name()> is a text file
binary search (currently implemented with L<Search::Dict>).

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over

=item C<$name = Math::OEIS::Names-E<gt>anum_to_name($anum)>

For a given C<$anum> string such as "A000001" return the sequence name
as a string, or if not found then return C<undef>.

The returned C<$name> may contain non-ASCII characters.  In Perl 5.8 and
higher they're returned as Perl wide chars.  In earlier Perl C<$name> is the
native encoding of the names file (which is UTF-8).

=item C<Math::OEIS::Names-E<gt>close()>

Close the F<names> file, if not already closed.

=back

=head2 Oopery

=over

=item C<$obj = Math::OEIS::Names-E<gt>new (key =E<gt> value, ...)>

Create and return a new C<Math::OEIS::Names> object to read an OEIS "names"
file.  The optional key/value parameters are

    filename => $filename         default ~/OEIS/names
    fh       => $filehandle

The default filename is F<~/OEIS/names>, or other directory per
F<Math::OEIS-E<gt>local_directories()> .  A different filename can be given
or an open filehandle.  When a file handle is given the C<filename> may be
used for diagnostics and so can be helpfully given too.

=item C<$name = $obj-E<gt>anum_to_name($anum)>

For a given C<$anum> string such as "A000001" return the sequence name
as a string, or if not found then return C<undef>.

=item C<$filename = $obj-E<gt>filename()>

Return the F<names> filename from a given C<$obj> object.  This is the
C<filename> parameter if given, or C<default_filename()> otherwise.

=item C<$filename = Math::OEIS::Names-E<gt>default_filename()>

=item C<$filename = $obj-E<gt>default_filename()>

Return the default filename which is used if no C<filename> or C<fh> option
is given.  C<default_filename()> can be called either as a class method or
object method.

=item C<$obj-E<gt>close()>

Close the file handle, if not already closed.
